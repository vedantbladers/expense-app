## Testing the Complete Workflow

### Complete User Journey Test:
1. **Employee creates expense**:
   - Signup as employee → Login → Create expense → View in dashboard
   
2. **Manager approves expense**:
   - Signup as manager → Login → Go to approvals → Approve employee's expense
   
3. **Employee sees approval**:
   - Employee dashboard auto-refreshes → Shows expense as "approved" with toast notification

4. **Admin manages system**:
   - Signup as admin → Access user management and approval rules

## Database Structure
```sql
-- Users table with role support
users: id, name, email, password, country, role

-- Expenses table with approval tracking  
expenses: id, description, date, paidBy, category, remarks, amount, currency, receipt, created_at, status, reviewed_by, reviewed_at
```

## Navigation Routes
- `/` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- `/login` → Login form
- `/signup` → Signup form with role selection
- `/dashboard` → User dashboard (all roles)
- `/employee` → Employee profile page
- `/new` → Create new expense (all roles)
- `/manager` → Manager approvals page
- `/admin-user-management` → Admin user management
- `/admin-approval-rules` → Admin approval rules

## Success Indicators

✅ Manager approval system with real-time updates
✅ Toast notifications throughout the system
✅ Consistent UI/UX across all pages
